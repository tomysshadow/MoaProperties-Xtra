MoaProperties Xtra 1.0.1
By Anthony Kleine

	This Director Xtra exposes MOA Properties to Lingo.
	There are several advantages to using MOA Properties:

	-dynamic property names: access properties by passing in symbols
	-avoid script errors: don't get alerts if you access a property that doesn't exist
	-unique properties: there are MOA Properties that can't be accessed with Lingo alone

	Note that not every property that can be accessed with Lingo is possible
	to access with MOA. To read about all the MOA Properties, see the topic
	titled Director Types and Miscellaneous API in the Director XDK.

	Some of the handlers take in an optional argument called options. It is
	a property list which can specify any combination of the following properties:

	-#movie: the index of a Movie, as an integer, from which to access the property.
	For example, you could access properties of a Movie In A Window. The default is
	the Active Movie.

	-#filmLoop: for Frame, Sound and Sprite MOA Properties, it is the Film Loop Member from
	which to access the property. The default is to use the Score. For other MOA Properties,
	this option is ignored.

	-#frame: for Frame, Sound and Sprite MOA Properties, it is the index of a Frame, as
	an integer, from which to access the property. The default is the Current Frame for
	the Score, or the First Frame for Film Loops. For other MOA Properties, this
	option is ignored.

	If a property in the options property list is void, or left unspecified, the default
	for that option is used.

	Works with all Director versions from 5 - 12.
